        <h3>The Motive</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I've had the pressure on me since my early days as being referred to as the golden boy, Mr. Perfect, or Blessed by God. 
            As well as all family members from grandparents to distant cousins all being compared to me or being told to be like me. 
            This pressure only means failure isn't an option!
