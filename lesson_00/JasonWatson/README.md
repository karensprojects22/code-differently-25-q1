## 📖 About Me 

I first fell in love with computers when they became a household item in my country. My love started from a curiosity to understand how things worked, what made them go, and what made them stop working. My first lessons in tech were from simple self-taught research and over the years my love grew and my path was established. I started to focus on signals and how they work.

I became Computer and Network technician with little over ten (10) years experince. Most of my work experiece was working with the government. I've worked with multiple companies to include the Jamaica Constabulary Force. In the year 2020, I started my own Tech Company called Chief IT Consulting. The Company specialised in computer repair and servicing. And Network building, repair and servicing. I've worked on a few machines such as DEll, HP, Lenovo, ASUS and a few more. But my main passion is being a Network Technician. Working with Juniper, CISCO and UNIFI hards is really cool. My enjoy come from bulding able to see what i've built. And the work it took. I've always hand a special love love signal analasis.

Currently I'm in the process of learning to code at Code Differently. With the goal to increase my Tech skills to open up new opportunities. I'm in the process of learning the basics, even thought challenging I'm willing to give it my all.
