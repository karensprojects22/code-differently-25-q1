### Availability

I'm always available from 9a-5p if you have any questions feel free to approach me. You can contact me through our Google Chat or if you need you can privately message me, my DMs are always open.

Currently, my Monday and Friday evenings are quite busy because that's when I'm usually working, but I usually try to reply as soon as I get home at 11p. If I don't get to replying I'll definitely answer in the morning.

### My Workflow

I'm a very hands-on and visual learner. If you give me instruction and I'm unsure how to execute it, I would need some sort of demonstration or some kind of draft of what you want me to do. Although, usually I'm able to visualize it in my head that gets my mind flowing.

I do enjoy listening to white noise or music while working. If you find me not responding to you I'm just hyperfocused so feel free to come up to me and tap me on the shoulder if you need anything.

### Feedback

If I'm doing anything wrong or if you have a method to complete the task more efficiently please feel free to critique my work in any way you see fit. I'm open to hearing feedback **anytime** 

I'm here to learn to work towards a Career in software I'm open for any criticisms and suggestions to improve and adapt my skillset.

Now as far as me giving or suggesting advice. I'll always first ask why you did something in one way rather than another. It's usually just me being curious. I want you to explain the thought process behind why you did something the way you did. I might further suggest another method which is a method I would use it may or may not be "better" or efficient but I always encourage you to do whatever makes you comfortable. I just like throwing ideas out there to give you more options.

### Getting to know me

I'm a car guy I love talking about cars or motorsport whether that be Formula 1, Rally, or Formula Drift. Some of my favorite drivers include Yuki Tsunoda, Alex Albon, and Keiichi Tsuchiya.
