# Justin Eklund README
# Introduction
Hello, my name is Justin Eklund. I'm an aspiring coder from Middletown Delaware. I was previously working at apex concrete which is a flooring installer. I helped install floors to the customers expectations as well as help manage the work area. I hope to make an impact somewhere in the coding or software engineering indusrty using my creativity and eventual expertise of the industry. I've also have been making music for almost 5 years. Music is something that I'm very passionate about. It helps me take my mind off things and allows me to express myself in ways that I would not do otherwise.


## Prerequisite
These are the things I need to boost productivty in the work space:
Relatively quiet workspace. I'm easily distracted, so having a focused workspace works best for me
Visual learner. I learn things or can comprehend things better seeing a visual example. Visual examples give me the most amount of details so I can take the best steps moving forward.

## Best ways to reach me
Not an early bird at all. Preferably not mornings, but if it has to be a morning, after 9am. Email is the most formal way to reach me but a text would always be the quickest. (I'm a 2000's baby so text is what I grew up with) Another way is by a social media DM. I check all my streams of communication daily, but you will most likely get an answer quicker on an off day through a text.
